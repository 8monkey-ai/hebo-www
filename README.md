# Welcome to hebo.ai!

This is the https://hebo.ai website developed with [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/).

## Getting Started

### Installation

Install the dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

### Development

Start the development server with HMR:

```bash
bun run dev
```

Your application will be available at `http://localhost:4173`.

## Building for Production

```

## Deployment

### AWS

The easiest way to deploy our website is to use the [SST](https://sst.dev/) template.

```bash
bun sst deploy --stage production
```

## Styling

This template comes with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) already configured for a simple default starting experience. You can use whatever CSS framework you prefer.
