This is the https://hebo.ai website developed with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

The design uses [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/TailwindCSS) and components are from [ShadCN](http://shadcndesign.com/).

## Deploy on AWS

The easiest way to deploy our website is to use the [SST](https://sst.dev/) template.

```bash
npx sst deploy --stage production
```
